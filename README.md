## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

$$
a = b \frac{1}{2}
$$

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Demo 1" %}
```bash
# code 1
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="More details" %}
```
# some other code
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
