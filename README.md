## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours. $$\sum_x x^2$$  also inline pics 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
hold shift and **click** the plus to insert inline elements \(equations, pics, etc\) while typing

 ![](.gitbook/assets/apod.jpg) 
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="demo1.sh" %}
```bash
# code 1
echo "hello world"
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Another demo here" %}
```
# some other code
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
